Q.18) Find largest sum contigeous sub array
Given an array Arr[] of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array(containing at least one number) which has the maximum sum and return its sum.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {1,2,3,-2,5}
Output:
9
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is 9
of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which 
is a contiguous subarray.
Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {-1,-2,-3,-4}
Output:
-1
Explanation:
Max subarray sum is -1 
of element (-1)

'''
l = [1,2,3,-2,5]
max = float('-inf')
for i in range(len(l)-1) :
  cs = l[i]
  for j in range(i+1,len(l)) :
    cs = cs + l[j]
    if max < l[i] :
      max = l[i]
    if max < l[j] :
      max = l[j]
    if max < cs :
      max = cs

print("Max sub array sum is :",max)
